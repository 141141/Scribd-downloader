* Scribd-downloader

A little shell script to download a pdf file from a scribd document. This script isn't perfect, but it's enough for me.

To use it, make sure you have installed phantomjs and ImageMagick with 
: sudo apt-get install phantomjs imagemagick

After, just run :
: $ ./scribd_download.sh <your url>

If you have any problem and you want to try more options, run
: $ ./scribd_download.sh
and you'll get a list of all options.


Example :
: $ ./scribd_download.sh http://fr.scribd.com/doc/24816204/Vanessa-Carlton-A-Thousand-Miles

The Scribd structure often changes, so if you have any problem, please contact me at tobias.bora -@- gmail -.- com, or let a message in the "Issues" section.
